# SignSupport 
This is an Android application that I developed as part of my Masters research project. The application is used by Deaf people to support their learning of computer literacy skills. The application consumes an XML file that structures the lesson content from the e-Learner Adult curriculum and previews lesson content via short video clips. The Deaf learner can navigate through different video using buttons on the interface to review, move forward within a lesson and between lessons.

#Development Requirements
1. Android Studio
2. Android SDK (API Level 18+)

#System Requirements
1. Android 4.3 Jelly Bean
